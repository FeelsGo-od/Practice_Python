1. Install the cryptography library:
pip install cryptography

2. Generate a Symmetric Key:
Use the Fernet class from the cryptography.fernet module to generate a secure symmetric key. This key will be used for both encryption and decryption.

3. Encrypting Files:
Read plaintext data from a file, encrypt it using AES with the generated key, and write the encrypted data to another file.

4. Decrypting Files:
Read the encrypted data from a file, decrypt it using AES with the same key used for encryption, and write the decrypted data to a new file.

5. Use:
Use the encrypt_file and decrypt_file functions to encrypt and decrypt files.
